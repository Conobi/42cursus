| Project | Description | Comments | Language |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Libft | Recoding of some standard C library functions | - | C |
| Get_Next_Line | Read a line from a file descriptor | - | C |
| Printf | Recoding of the printf function | - | C |
| Pipex | Reproduce the behavior of the shell command pipe | - | C |
| Born2BeRoot | Introduction to system administration and virtualization (using VirtualBox) | I made it with the bonuses, **encrypted partitions**, custom monitoring script using `jq` and a **fully working Wordpress**. | - |
| Push_Swap | Sort a stack of numbers using two stacks and a limited set of operations | - | C |
| Minishell | Recoding of a lightweight `sh`, and some `coreutils` basic commands | We did MeteoShell, **a shell with the weather of Lyon** in the prompt. I made the pretty strong parser, a garbage collector, and of course lots of tests. **And the weather integration!** | C |
| Fractol | A Fractal renderer | **My favorite project**! I implemented the renderer with **5 fractals**, different color palettes and nice gradients, resolution and custom controls options. | C |
| Philosophers | A simulation of the dining philosophers problem. Basically threads, forks, mutex and data races! | - | C |
| Cub3D | Recoding of the Wolfenstein 3D engine | We did **Backrooms3D** (a Cub3D in the style of the famous backrooms), **with nice performances**, and custom textures. I worked on the parser, parts of the renderer and the collisions.  | C |
| NetPractice | Introduction to network administration and security, with IP routing | My DNS and sysadmin knowledge helped me during the exercise. | - |
| Piscine C++ | A 2 weeks intensive C++ course | I loved this piscine. My code was **designed to be strong**, it took me longer than expected, but **I learned a lot about OOP**. [I did my own code style (in `Clang-format`), that follows the Norm principles](https://gist.github.com/Donokami/128d8572ffa18bdac2e5bd53a8e1e234). | C++ |
| IRC | A simple IRC server and client | I carefully followed the documentation, and **refactored** most of the code. I was primarily **involved in the parsing** of the messages | C++ |
| Inception | Introduction to virtualization with Docker | I followed good practices, and did use `wp-cli` to support the deployment of the image. | YAML/Docker |
| [Transcendence](https://github.com/Donokami/transcendence) | A multiplayer browser Pong game | I **leaded the tech stack** (with bad decisions and good ones involved). I **made the game engine in full 3D**, with **advanced physics** and **lightning**, and refactored some code (both on back and frontend). I worked with **WebSockets**, **the game UI/UX**, the **leaderboard**, and the **matchmaking**. | Typescript, Vue.JS |
